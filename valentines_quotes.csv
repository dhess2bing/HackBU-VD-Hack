"Love is like the wind, you can't see it but you can feel it."
One is loved because one is loved. No reason is needed for loving.
"Each time you love, love as deeply as if it were forever."
"Loving is not just looking at each other, it’s looking in the same direction."
You always gain by giving love.
Lovers don't finally meet somewhere. They're in each other all along. 
"A flower cannot blossom without sunshine, and man cannot live without love. "
"Love grows more tremendously full, swift, poignant, as the years multiply. "
If I had a flower for every time I thought of you ... I could walk through my garden forever. 
I carry your heart (I carry it in my heart) 
All you need is love. But a little chocolate now and then doesn't hurt.
You know you're in love when you can't fall asleep because reality is finally better than your dreams.
The best thing to hold onto in life is each other.
Love is our true destiny. We do not find the meaning of life by ourselves alone — we find it with another.
"If you find someone you love in your life, then hang on to that love."
You can't blame gravity for falling in love.
The heart has its reasons of which reason knows nothing.
They invented hugs to let people know you love them without saying anything.
"For it was not into my ear you whispered, but into my heart. It was not my lips you kissed, but my soul."
"I know of only one duty, and that is to love."
Kisses are a better fate than wisdom.
"Oh, if it be to choose and call thee mine, love, thou art every day my Valentine!"
"If you live to be a hundred, I want to live to be a hundred minus one day so I never have to live without you."
There is always some madness in love. But there is also always some reason in madness.
We are most alive when we're in love.
Love is friendship that has caught fire.
"There is only one happiness in this life, to love and be loved."
"Being deeply loved by someone gives you strength, while loving someone deeply gives you courage."
There is no charm equal to tenderness of heart.
"Today is Valentine's Day — or, as men like to call it, Extortion Day!"
